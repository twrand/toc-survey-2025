ToC-Survey-Full-Snapshot-2024-11-13.csv contains data from the 166 survey responses we recieved up to 13 November 2024. Answers to the following questions have been removed to protect anonymity of the participants:
	Question 2.2: "If there are closely related subtopics not included on the list [of ToC-related topics] above that you think should be included, list them here."
	Question 3.1a: "List the name and course number of the course at your institution in which most students who learn automata theory first encounter it at significant depth. (Answer "none" if no course covers a significant amount of material in automata theory.)"
	Question 3.1b: "List the name and course number of the course at your institution in which most students who learn computability theory first encounter it at significant depth. (Answer "none" if no course covers a significant amount of material in computability theory.)"
	Question 3.1c: "List the name and course number of the course at your institution in which most students who learn basic complexity theory first encounter it at significant depth. (Answer "none" if no course covers a significant amount of material in basic complexity theory.)"
	Question 4.1: "List the name and course number of any courses at your institution, in addition to those you described in Question 3.1, that include material from at least one of Automata Theory, Computability Theory, or Complexity Theory."
	Question 4.2: "Which if any of the courses listed in Question 4.1 are required for at least one CS major or major-equivalent program at your institution?"
	Question 4.3: "Do you regularly have undergraduate students take a graduate-level theory course? If so, give a brief description of that course and its prerequisites.'
	Question 5.1 (continued): "For the [digital pedagogy] tool listed above that you use most often, please describe how you use it in your course. (If you don't use any of the tools listed above, skip this question.)"
	Question 5.2 (continued): "For the [ToC-specific] tool listed above that you use most often, please describe how you use it in your course. (If you don't use any of the tools listed above, skip this question.)"
	Question 5.3: "If theory-focused courses at your institution make use of tools or applications not listed above, list them here."
	Additional Feedback: "If you would like to add any additional information to your answers or have other feedback, please include it here."
	Names of specific courses that appear elsewhere in the data have been replaced with [Course Name Removed]
